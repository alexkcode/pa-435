# GIS Final Project - Clustering for Economic Development Analysis

## Overview

The main question we are attempting to answer in this project is, what are areas of Chicago lacking in development in such a way that quality of life is impacted? To answer this question we use historical Tax Increment Finance development data, GIS data and other related household economic data from the US Census public data sets, like income.
